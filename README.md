# BuildingSimpleWebApp

During 2023 summer holidays, the transmission period from Sixth Form to University, I've decided to learn the programming language Java, which I then was able to use to build a spring boot application. The purpose of this spring boot application was to apply my newly learned knowledge of Java and Spring Boot. Spring Boot, or specifically the Spring Framework, is a framework that is used to build web applications, it's commonly used by large entreprises, such as Netflix, as it makes it easily to start building web applications as it removes majority of the boiler plate code that would be required otherwise. 

With Java & Spring Boot I've managed to:
- Allow the user, known as the customer, to register an account
- Allow the user to log into its account
- Allow the user to request a password reset via Email which uses a unique token within the URL
- Store user details within mySQL database
- Store the users password using a password-hashing algorithm known as BCrpyt within the DB
- Incorporate JUnit and Integration Testing
- Incorporate Logging

If i was to improve the web application, I would make use of session ids which I'd store in noSQL in memory DB such as Redis. I'd also allow the user the ability to update its user details, logout, delete its account, and upload a user profile.

I had so much fun learning learning these technologies, in particular JUnit & Integration testing, as it was something I particularly struggled a lot with in the beginning but was then able to overcome these challenges at a later point in my learning!
